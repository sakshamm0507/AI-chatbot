# Gemini Chatbot with Content Filtering


This project is a Python-based chatbot that uses Google's **Gemini API** to generate responses to user queries. It includes a **content filtering mechanism** to detect and block inappropriate queries or responses. If a user enters an inappropriate query, the chatbot will notify the user and skip generating a response. Similarly, if the generated response is inappropriate, it will not be displayed.
